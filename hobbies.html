		<h1> MY TWO MAIN HOBBIES </h1>

			<h1> GAMING </h1>
			<p> I still remember the first video game I ever got to play. It was back in the time where they put computer games inside cereal boxes as a publicity stunt. My 
			first was Rollercoaster Tycoon the original. It was created by hasbro interactive and was the first game I ever loaded into a computer. Ever since then, I have fallen
			in love with video games and have played countless hours of many different genres. My all-time favourite has to be the Warcraft series all the way to the current version of
			World of Warcraft.</p>
			<p> This hobby and passion is what drives me to follow this career path. I am eager to gain experience creating games and I have to say my favourite classes in the program 
			are the game engine classes. Although, the internet programming class is also very fun as the knowledge is easily applicable throughout life, especially when working in
			technology.</p>

			<h1> SPORTS </h1>
			<p> I have been involved in sports since a very young age. First it was low-level soccer, then I discovered hockey and fell in love with it. I started playing when I was 8
			years old and only stopped when I was 19 years old due to schedule conflict with my part-time job and school.</p>
			<p> Without doubt, I have been a very big Montreal Canadiens fan since I was young. Despite hockey being the sport I preferred playing, I do enjoy following soccer
			when the Euro and World Cup come around every 2 years since I get to watch France play.</p>
