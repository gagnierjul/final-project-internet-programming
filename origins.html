		<div class="originPanel">

		<p> On my father's side, our family roots lie in Quebec from the very beginning. My grandmother on my father's side is of Acadian descent but, other than that, that side 
		of the family is purely French Canadian.</p>
		<p> The French roots are all on my mother's side as both of my grandparents were parisians. My grandfather fought in World War II and, unfortunetaly I never had the chance
		to meet him. My grandmother immigrated to Canada with my mother searching for a new beginning after her husband had passed away during the war.</p>
