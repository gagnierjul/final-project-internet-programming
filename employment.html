		<p> I am currently employed by Starbucks as a Barista. I chose to work here for the incredible benefits they offer to part-time workers as well as my
		love for coffee. Despite the fact that this job does not have any connection with my field of studies, I still find it challenging at times as well as engaing.</p>

		<p> A small fun fact, it is quite amazing that I got this job, because I ended up meeting my partner there! </p>

		</a>
		<p> I worked as a field technician for Bell Canada for about two years. My job was to reach customer's houses and install or repair Bell products such as; 
		fiber optic internet, copper internet, television or phone lines. I was provided with all the tools as well as a company truck to use during my working hours.</p>

		<p> This was very good experience not only in understanding the telecommunications infrastructure, but also for customer service. It was a very unusual job for 
		a student, but the funny thing is I found this job at a CEGEP carreer fair.</p>
